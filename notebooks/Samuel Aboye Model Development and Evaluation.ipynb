    "The recommendation system was developed using a hybrid approach that combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. The content-based filtering utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to analyze course descriptions, computing a cosine similarity matrix to identify courses with similar content. Additionally, features such as 'University' and 'Difficulty Level' were encoded to ensure diversity in recommendations. For collaborative filtering, user and item IDs were generated to simulate user interactions with courses, and the SVD algorithm was employed to predict user preferences.\n",
    "The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the collaborative filtering model. The hybrid recommendation process involves generating content-based recommendations, ensuring diversity, and combining these with collaborative filtering recommendations. This combined approach aims to leverage the strengths of both methods to provide highly relevant and comprehensive recommendations.\n"
